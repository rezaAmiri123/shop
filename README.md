This project has being developed for test that I'm learning.
It is important for me to learn Django framework.

This project has been covered some section, for example:

1 - django for backend

2 - celery for async process 

3 - docker for container section

4 - nginx for reverse proxy server

5 - postgres for database server

6 - rabbitMQ for queue server 

7 - html, css, javascript for frontend section

8 - redis for cache server

9 - gunicron is used for wsgi server

The backend section covers some section, for example:

1 - The cart app is used for work with shop cart that works with session framework

2 - gettext is used for handle translation 

The project is't complete and I'm working to add something to that
